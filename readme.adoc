# My Dockerfile and docker-compose

* For development, I mostly use Podman instead of Docker.
Except some applications that only supports Docker (e.g. Cosign)
* Please check the license of the components of the container images.
** Using Apache 2.0 License for the Dockerfiles and docker-compose
does not mean the container image is under Apache 2.0 License.
** The created container image would contain
other software (such as Bash, glibc and etc.), these software may
be in different licenses.
* Please check any direct and in-direct dependency of the software
being produced or contained.

== Container image verification by Cosign

If the container is signed (by me). You can verify by below steps:

. Get my Cosign public key and save as cosign.pub
+
[source,plaintext]
----
-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
MFkwEwYHKoZIzj0CAQYIKoZIzj0DAQcDQgAENAxpHzZWHRHsR72J+Zzm6M32UAvv
YeHhQD4doXjqNXHbgXI212HVfmLzBevCvUqurwPvEsTf9FqWuYHUUrrK6w==
-----END PUBLIC KEY-----
----
+
. Command for Cosign
+
[source,bash]
----
cosign verify --key cosign.pub \
  [container-registry/project-name:tag]
----
+
Example:
+
[source,bash]
----
cosign verify --key cosign.pub \
  ghcr.io/patrickdung/meilisearch-crossbuild:v0.24.0
----
+
. Output:
+
----
Verification for ghcr.io/patrickdung/meilisearch-crossbuild:v0.24.0 --
The following checks were performed on each of these signatures:
  - The cosign claims were validated
  - The signatures were verified against the specified public key
  - Any certificates were verified against the Fulcio roots.

[{"critical":{"identity":{"docker-reference":"ghcr.io/patrickdung/meilisearch-crossbuild"},"image":{"docker-manifest-digest":"sha256:41969fc06309c9988a23aa5a1ca677c171c9011399527d2c2120bab87ea9311a"},"type":"cosign container image signature"},"optional":null}]
