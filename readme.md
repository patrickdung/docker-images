# Dockerfile and docker-compose

- For development, I am using Podman instead of Docker
- Apache 2.0 License for the Dockerfiles and docker-compose
This does not mean the container image is under Apache 2.0 License.
The created continer image would contain
other software (such as Bash, glibc and etc.).

Please check any direct and in-direct dependency of the software
being produced or containted.
